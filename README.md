**Project Goals**:
Analyze road accident trends over time.
Identify high-risk areas for road accidents.
Examine contributing factors to accidents (e.g., weather, time of day).
Provide visual insights to support stakeholders in enhancing road safety.

**Tools and Technologies**:
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
Excel: For data cleaning, manipulation, and preliminary analysis.
SQL: For querying and managing the accident data.
Tableau: For advanced visual analytics and sharing insights.


****Setup Instructions**
Prerequisites**:
Install Microsoft Excel
Install SQL Server or use an SQL platform (like MySQL or PostgreSQL)
Install Power BI Desktop
Install Tableau Desktop

**Step 1: Data Acquisition**:
Download the accident dataset from the designated source.
Ensure data cleanliness by checking for missing or inconsistent data in Excel.

**Step 2: Data Preparation**:
Use Excel to preprocess the data:
Remove duplicates
Handle missing values
Format columns appropriately (dates, categories, etc.)
Upload the cleaned data to your SQL database.

**Step 3: Data Analysis with SQL**:
Connect to your SQL database.
Run queries to extract relevant data:
sql
SELECT * FROM accidents WHERE accident_date BETWEEN 'YYYY-MM-DD' AND 'YYYY-MM-DD';
Create views for common analyses (e.g., accidents by month, by location).

****Step 4: Visualizations**:
Using Power BI**
Import data from SQL.
Create dashboards focusing on:
Monthly accident trends
Heat maps of accident locations
Bar charts of contributing factors

**Using Tableau**:
Connect Tableau to your SQL database.
Build visualizations such as:
Time series analysis of accidents
Correlation between weather conditions and accident rates
Visualizations
Include screenshots or links to dashboards and reports created in Power BI and Tableau.
Describe key insights derived from each visualization.


**Conclusion**
This project highlights the importance of data analysis in understanding road safety. By leveraging tools like Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Tableau, we can provide valuable insights to reduce road accidents and enhance public safety measures.
